# Plumbum - A programming language

(Work in progress)

---
Goal: a simple prototyping language with the following features:
* Pipe-driven syntax (left to right data manipulation)
* Adjustable precision (e.g. strict type operations, static types, etc.)
* Tunable garbage collection
* Transpilation (to C code) or interpretation 


Requires `clum-lib` and `makemake` for functionality.
